Skinsy Eden Riesling, McLaren Vale Grenache, Piccadilly Valley Chardonnay, Basket Range Pinot Noir and Barossa Grenache with more to come as James finds his groove and grows. All Ada grapes are from small growers who farm the land respectively and organically.

For James and Jessica Audas the vision of working the land, being in touch with nature and living within their means came to life a few years ago when they made the leap from Sydney and ended up with an off grid permaculture farm in West Gippsland Victoria. Many of you have no doubt shared Jess and James journey and it was very exciting a few months ago when we decided that the time was right to take on this exciting brand and let Jess and James dedicate a greater portion of time to growing the grapes they make.`,\n    STORY_2: `When A.R.C started they sourced fruit from a selection of vineyards predominantly in the nearby Mornington Peninsula which allowed them to further learn their craft, experiment and establish a greater vision and direction for the brand. During this time James worked alongside William Downie in both the cellar and vineyards giving up every spare minute he had to immerse himself in hands off winemaking and biodynamic viticulture. Team ARC firmly believe in ethical farming practices and in early 2020 they took on the lease of 3ha of established biodynamic vines just outside the town of Warragul. This amazing site is perched between the foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and Mount Baw Baw to the north. Its rich red volcanic soils produce wines of elegance, poise and character. In addition to their 3ha they have planted a very exciting close planted vineyard at home (Karinya Grove). This site comprises of Aligote, Chenin Blanc and Gamay grown at 475m in altitude with a permaculture philosophy. We are delighted to see A.R.C evolve as they continue to understand and learn from these magical sites. For Jess and James the work in the cellar is hands off, preferring not to manipulate the wines and rather let them express their fruit and journey. All wines are wild ferment, not filtered or fined and sulphur is only added in small parts where deemed necessary.`,\n    STORY_3: `The playful ARC labels are inspired by flora and fauna special to the couple. The white labels (Mornington Peninsula wines) are characters from their small hobby farm Karinya Grove, while the Black Labels (Gippsland) are flora and fauna from from the vineyards themselves expressing a deep sense of place and nativity of that site.

Creating a sense of community was a deep part of this plan, a place to call home and where they could raise their daughter Frankie around home grown food, great music and with a love and appreciation for the land.`,\n    STORY_2: `They lease three vineyards and are planning the planting of two more on their farm, which is located on the outskirts of Mt Gambier, SA.

Erupting less than 6000 years ago it is filled with water that changes colour with the seasons. Arising from an ancient inland sea made into limestone and now receiving water from underground caves added with our generous rainfall all contributes to the abundance of water stored in underground limestone caves with pockets of flint rock spread below the nearby soils. The limestone filters the water naturally and the result is a pure water thriving with minerality. All this helps make for incredible soil complexity and their cool climate makes for perfect growing conditions and in turn beautiful, elegant and totally unique wines like no other.`,\n    STORY_3: `They make wines that reflect the eccentricities of their own personalities as well as deeply reflecting place and terroir with a minimalistic approach. They use old world wine methods; preferring the challenges of hand picking fruit, open fermenting with indigenous yeast and only adding sulphur when required by the wine. They do not filter or fine wines and they are all bottled on site in their small winery.\n      Mount Gambier is a truly unique wine growing region and one that over the next few years is due likely to grow in understanding and popularity. Over the last few years these wines have gone from strength to strength as cuvees have tightened and become more precise.

Despite only meeting his great grandfather as a two year old Dan feels an incredible connection to him and his nordic heritage. His middle name is Sigurd and despite copping a small amount of grief through high school he proudly uses it his brand name.`,\n    STORY_2: `His grandfather travelled from Norway to find work in Australia back in the early days (he was 19, so around 1914) and found the quickest way to become a citizen was to join the army, so he was sent over to Europe fight for Australia. A larrikin at heart he was caught AWOL after being shot early into his service and then sent back to the front lines in France as punishment, where he was shot again…. This time in the elbow which made him useless at holding a gun, luckily this time he was sent back to Australia. His stories amongst the family were legendary and his constant smile and mischievous behaviour was always something Daniel related to. For any of you who have met Dan you will of course know this to be true.`,\n    STORY_3: `Daniel grew up in central western New South Wales and from a young age was immersed in grape growing and winemaking. During school holidays he would pick up work with large wineries picking fruit or pruning vines. This led him to Charles Sturt University where he completed his double Wine/Viticulture degree at Wagga Wagga. His desire to understand different regions led him to vintages in New Zealand (Central Otago), Canada (Okanagan Valley), Portugal (Alentejo), France (Hermitage) and Italy (Barolo). After spending some time back in Australia working for Jacobs Creek his desire to start a small label focusing on organically grown grapes stated to burgeon. He knew that the mechanical, conventional way of doing things wasn’t for him and so in 2012 Sigurd was born. He moved to a smaller winery RedHeads studio wines, which he was given the task of re-invigorating. This also allowed Dan to explore his own label on the side. The first wine under Sigurd was a quirky single hogshead of Riesling fermented with Gewürztraminer skins just labeled as the white. From here a red GSM (now GSMN), Rose, Chenin, Syrah and now Carignan have joined the range with fleeting appearances of Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.\n      Every vintage of Sigurd is subtly different, be it a change in the blend or style to best show off that years conditions. For the most part Dan’s grapes are sourced or grown under organic principles, something he is working hard to have across the board. Once in the cellar his wines are as hands off as possible with only indigenous yeasts used, no adjustments of acid or tannin and minimal sulphur added at bottling (max 30ppm). He is proud of the Barossa Valley and his reds in particular speak of the richness of the terroir while still harbouring an immense freshness and drinkability, not always an easy task in one of Australia’s warmest regions. Dan is one of the most exciting winemakers coming out of the Barossa and we are so thrilled with his evolution over the last few years.`,\n    LIST: [{\n      ID: 0,\n      WINE: \"Sigurd Riesling\",\n      PRODUCER: \"Sigurd\",\n      COUNTRY: \"Australia\",\n      REGION: \"Eden Valley, Barossa Valley\",\n      VARIETY: \"Riesling\",\n      STYLE: \"White\",\n      ABOUT: `A mixture of 90% high Eden Valley fruit from the white blend vineyard and 10% Clare Valley fruit from the Chenin Blanc vineyard, this Riesling was fermented in a separate 1600L Foudre and Barrique, pressed as whole bunches straight to oak, left for around 7 months and then racked off solids and in to tank where a small amount of sulphur was added before bottling.

After moving to Melbourne in 2010 to pursue a physiotherapy degree and chase his dream of playing representative cricket he got a job working at his local Dan Murphy’s. Bit by bit over his two years at Dan’s he began to feel more intrigued and comfortable around wine and so after finishing his degree he decided to enrol back into university but this time at Charles Sturt for Viticulture and Winemaking. Whist studying he returned to Tasmania and spent a season pruning in the vines at Stefano Lubaina and a year working the wine bar and cellar door at Moorilla.\n      It was by chance at one of the first editions of Bottletops that he met Pat Underwood from Little Reddie and was struck by the world of minimal intervention wine. In late 2016 following this meeting he moved up to Victoria and completed his first vintage at the Boomtown Cooperative winery followed by a full season working at both Oakridge and then Mac Forbes where he spent most of his time helping to manage the vineyards. Post the 2019 harvest with Mac he jetted over to his father’s homeland of Germany to complete vintage with fellow Lo-Fi winery Melshimer.

This is where he makes his Sonnen Wines.\n      Sonnen for Luke is the exploration of all he has learnt across his short journey in wine. He wants the wines to speak deeply of Tasmania and the vineyards they are sourced from but have an experimental edge when it comes to winemaking. His release from 2021 wowed us, with his Jannis Riesling a particular highlight, almost reminiscent of the orange wines of Melsheimer.

Claus first started making wine with this father as a hobby, but after working with Hans Nittnaus, a neighbouring winemaker for a few years, decided that wine was his true calling. In 2004 he was one of the founding members of the Pannobile group of winemakers, a group that uses respect for the land and terroir to preserve traditions in Burgenland. His first vintage was in 2000, and since then he has expanded his father’s 3 hectares to the 17 hectares of vines he cultivates today. His vineyard work is meticulous and he is deeply in touch with his land. He uses a mixture of techniques including homeopathic teas, compost from cattle and horses and works strictly from Steiner philosophies. His vines are spread across 58 parcels and are largely planted to indigenous varieties such as Zweigelt, Blaufränkisch and St. Laurent.`,\n    STORY_2: `More recently Claus has started working with Grüner Veltliner and Weissburgunder, producing distinctive, skin fermented white wines. Despite the modernity of his striking winery everything done inside is hands-off and inherently natural, with indigenous yeasts taking control of each years ferments. Claus’ priority has always been to produce wine that is pure, balanced, and expressive of his terroir. His winemaking methods are very much guided by instinct rather than set formula, and he is perpetually experimenting and evolving, making wine that is markedly different in style to the classic interpretations coming out of the region. Claus was one of the first Austrian winemakers to start experimenting with skin contact wines fermented in Georgian amphorae. His 2009 Weissburgunder from the Edelgraben vineyard was the first vintage he bottled in this style, and since then he has been vinifying the whole Edelgraben range in amphorae.`,\n    STORY_3: `Claus is deeply committed to working in harmony with nature, and has been certified biodynamic since 2009. He also keeps his cellar interventions to a minimum, strongly advocating for wines that achieve balance naturally. Very little sulphur is added to his wines - Claus decides just before bottling if it is strictly necessary.\n      Claus is spearheading a new wave of great young Austrian producers with a non-apologetic, genuine and credible approach.

When Michael finished agricultural school in 2002 it was clear that he wanted to run the farm that his family had owned since 1807. This farm has always practiced mixed agriculture with crops, livestock, forestry and wine. Michael was fascinated with fermentation and took over the responsibility for vinification during his school years. He followed the common doctrine but was never happy with his early wines. It was only through stepping back and looking at the wines of his grandfather, a man who worked much more simply, with nearly no manipulation or intervention that Michael found his style and mantra. In 2012 Inspired by this he converted his winery and vineyards to Demeter bio-dynamics and began experimenting. Now Michael takes holistic farming to new heights with what he calls ‘close-circuit bio-dynamics’ - nothing comes into the winery, nothing comes out. This includes his barrels, which he makes himself from Acacia wood from the nearby forest.`,\n    STORY_2: `His 10 hectares of vines are planted extremely densely, with 7,000-10,000 vines per hectare growing on loam and loess soil. This forces the vines to behave highly competitively, resulting in low yields of highly concentrated fruit. He uses cover crops to keep down weeds and pest control is handled by the buzzards (Buteos) that roam the vineyards. He tucks his shoots instead of cutting them off at the top so that the energy of the plant goes to the fruit, rather than the stress of making new shoots at the cut end. A plethora of animals also inhabit the Gindl farm. Highland cattle have been bred since 2012, his 3 horses manage all of the work in the vineyards and a flock of goats and Breton dwarf sheep help to manage the weeds and increase fertility.`,\n    STORY_3: `In 2012 along with his certification Michael decided to rename and brand his property. He landed on MG vom Sol. Sol is the oldest vineyard ever documented in his hometown of Hohenruppersdorf, with plantings dating back to the 14th century. His grandfather revitalised this site, replanting to Gruner Veltliner and Weissburgunder 45 years ago. This remains the only Single Vineyard wine he makes preferring to harvest his 10 hectares by hand in three passes, picking on flavour and ripeness to create his special blends. To preserve the individuality and genuineness obtained in the vineyards, Michael try’s to do as little as possible in the cellar. The grapes are pressed very gently, rarely racked and fermented spontaneously without any use of selected yeast or temperature control. The wines remain on the lees for a very long time and selected cuvees get a small dose of sulphur dioxide before bottling.\n      Michaels is above all a farmer and a very talented one at that. His love for his vines, animals and their interaction makes his one of the most inspiring people we have come across.

Some will know the Beaufort name here in Australia and after making the wines of his family estate for many years he recently broke away from the family business to focus on his own Champagne project. In late 2021 Amaury Beaufort released his first champagne under his own name, from a 0.88ha champagne parcel called Le Jardinot in Polisy and we are delighted to have just received a small top up of stock just in time for Christmas.`,\n    STORY_2: `After completing viticultural studies in Beaune in 2005, he worked many years for his family estate, Champagne André Beaufort, helping ensure the succession to his own generation. In parallel with the projects of his family, he planted 5ha near Tonnère, and produced still wine from 2007 until 2017 as Les Larmes de Divona. By 2018, Amaury sought a clean break. He split off from his work with the family, and began farming his own 0.88ha parcel in Polisy the way he liked. A gentle, mostly east-facing slope of pinot noir on kimmeridgian clay-limestone, capped with a section of chardonnay on portlandian clay limestone, Le Jardinot (as the parcel and the resultant champagne are called) is bordered on two sides by woodland. Planted in 1972, right after Amaury’s father Jacques Beaufort’s conversion to organics, the parcel has never seen synthetic treatments. It comprised part of Champagne André Beaufort until 2018, when Amaury broke off from the family enterprise to pursue his own champagne production.`,\n    STORY_3: `Beaufort takes care to understate the differences that led him to break from the family estate and his négociant work with his brothers. But it doesn’t take much reading between the lines to see where Amaury’s priorities lie in viticulture. “For me the system is there always needs to be life in the soil,” he says. “Practically all the vignerons who work organically, they farm the vines, but they don’t farm the soil. They plow, they remove all the grass. Then it’s all naked. But there are a lot of microorganisms that need grass cover. I want my soil to play the role of a sponge. So when it rains, it absorbs it, and when it’s dry, only the surface dries out.” Here the under-emphasized issue is that maintaining grass cover entails a drop in yields, and the financial loss is all the more significant in regions where land is astronomically expensive. Beaufort also prefers to avoid vine trimming, finding it encourages root expansion and a greater resistance to pests and problems. Beaufort also credits late, careful pruning, in successive stages, with allowing him to avoid 2021’s catastrophic frosts.\n      In the cellar Beaufort ages his vin clairs for up to 21 months, this is extraordinarily long for Champagne vignerons working at his scale. With his close proximity to Burgundy, Amaury’s vinification techniques are more similar to Burgundy than classic Champagne. Fermentation begins in large 15hl oval casks. He doesn’t do battonage by hand, the shape of his casks allows for natural battonage. The wines are then transferred to Demi-muids for settling and further ageing. Wines are full natural fermentation with secondary fermentation from a selection natural yeast cultures the family have been using for over 20 years. No sulphur is added through the process and all wines remain unfiltered and unfined.\n      For us this is the most striking Champagne we have come across. It has a remarkable purity and linearity, something commonly seen in the past still wines he has produced. We are immensely proud to be brining these to Australia in extremely small amounts and look forward to expanding his range with a Rose and Coteaux Champenoise in the coming months.`,\n    LIST: [{\n      ID: 0,\n      WINE: \"Jardinot\",\n      PRODUCER: \"Amaury Beaufort\",\n      COUNTRY: \"France\",\n      REGION: \"Champagne\",\n      VARIETY: \"Pinot Noir Blend\",\n      STYLE: \"Sparkling\",\n      ABOUT: `The first iteration of Jaridnot, spontaneous fermentation in barrels with no added sulphites, Aged for 17 months in barrels and thick-stave casks, bottled with harvest yeasts, disgorged without dosage 10/14/21.

Maturing in concrete vats has also become important for her, giving the wines a fine tannic structure, delicacy and freshness.\n      The first release in Australia is her Cote du Rhone Blend and in the coming years we look forward to welcoming her very first classified Châteauneuf-du-Pape wines.

Most of the vines are individual bush vines, ranging from 20 to 70 years of age, and are planted on sandy loam on sandstone soils. Its these vineyards where he has taken great influence from good friend Thierry Forestier who has helped Joe in the early stages of viticultural management.`,\n    STORY_3: `He also has another smaller plot and his cellar a 15 minute drive away in St.Côme et Maruejols. Here he takes direct influence from Eric Pfifferling who has a plot that sits next to Joe. In the cellar Joé is working with mentor Alain Allier (who’s been making wine for about 15 years) to make wines in a low-interventionist manner. All wines see a small 10-20 part so2 addition.\n      For us Joé embraces the spirit of true vigneron culture in France which is to say he is a fierce ambassador for organic farming, making wines naturally, limiting additions to just sulphur (if at all), and making sure the wines are beautiful and well-made. His wines are true to variety, region and type and testament to all the effort he puts into his vineyard and winery.`,\n    LIST: [{\n      ID: 0,\n      WINE: \"Rosé\",\n      PRODUCER: \"Joe Chandellier\",\n      COUNTRY: \"France\",\n      REGION: \"Languedoc\",\n      VARIETY: \"Carignan/Syrah\",\n      STYLE: \"Rosé\",\n      ABOUT: `60% Carignan 40% Syrah from bush vines aged 90 years old, planted on deep silt soils.

Interestingly enough there isn’t a sparkling wine in sight in Luc’s cellar.`,\n    STORY_2: `Luc is deeply committed to biodynamics and farming. He was trained as an agricultural engineer but over time found his love for vines and a career in winemaking took over. Before settling in Bugey he worked with the likes of Domaine de la Soufrandière (Bret Brothers), Philippe Jambon in Beaujolais as well as in Canada. In his spare time he also works for the Association des Producteurs Bio du Rhône et de la Loire whose aim is to help winegrowers to convert to organic farming and viticulture, a goal he is deeply passionate about.\n      The estate of Grangeons de l’Albarine consists of nearly 2.5 ha of vineyards spread over several sites. 1.2 ha are worked on the incredibly steep slope of Argis (pictured above) and divided into two parcels, the Chateau, and Paradis. These vines are nearly 50 years old on a limestone base and planted to Chardonnay, Rousette and Monduse. In addition, a 0.5 ha 50 year old plot called Combernand, “La Cluse des Peintres” was taken over in 2014 in nearby Rossillon, with three grape varieties: Gamay, Chardonnay and Aligoté. This site has a gentler east-facing slope and is planted to pebbly soils. In 2015 Luc added what he now regards as his most prized site 0.4 ha of vines in St Sorlin en Bugey. The site named “Clos de Beauregard” sits on a hillside overlooking the Rhone, with 60-year-old vines of Gamay and Altesse planted over rocky shards of limestone. Finally a small plot of Mondeuse and Chasselas was also taken again in 2015, with 0.5 ha of 20-year-old vines that have a denser limestone over clay soils.`,\n    STORY_3: `The array of vineyards that Luc has assembled is all worked by hand. They are very tough sites and we were in awe of how hard he works and how challenging the site must be to manage. All of these sites have been converted to organic farming and are certified. Luc employs biodynamic principles to his vineyards and hopes to certify over the next few seasons. In the cellar Luc’s desire is to produce wines that speak of the terroir of Bugey. As such his winemaking style is very neutral. He direct presses his whites to old wooden vessels, his reds he keeps on skin in stainless tanks for a short time before pressing to the same old wooden barrels. All wines are wild fermented and remain unfiltered and unfined, instead being racked a few times before bottling for purity and clarity. He adds small amounts of sulphur for each cuvee where he sees a need for it.\n      The wines of Les Grangeons de l’Albarine are as wholesome as they come. They speak deeply of the forgotten region of Bugey and show absolute purity through each cuvee.

Neither of them had any experience or formal education as winemakers prior to opening their own winery, nor did they come from vigneron families.

Ludwig had fallen in love with Burgundy, and completed time working with a good friend in Saint Aubin. He had initially hoped to purchase land there, however due to financial constraints, the family found that the Jura proved significantly better suited for them. This led to the purchase of Les Chais du Vieux Bourg (now Lulu Vigneron) in 2000. Their first vintage came shortly after in 2002.`,\n    STORY_3: `The original vineyard is about 2.5 hectares in Arlay, in the centre of the Jura, and Ludwig has since expanded the estate to include vineyards in Poligny, l’Etoile and the legendary Château-Chalon.

They are currently going through biodynamic conversion for all vineyards and hope to achieve certification by the 2019 vintage. The soil is very unique, with two marly layers and a calcareous stratus, which is rich in fossilized oysters. Vine age varies from new vines of Trousseau that replaced his previous holdings of Pinot Noir to 55-year-old vines of Savignan.\n      Ludwig’s motto “the wine is made in the vineyard” is exemplified by the fact Ludwig works with the vines every day. He has a completely natural approach to wine making with a dedication to a non-interventionism and an affinity for making wine in a traditional style. He only takes the best clusters during selections, and uses almost mad pruning techniques to keep yields as low as possible. Ludwig’s fermentations are done at very low temperatures, lengthening the process for up to two years.

We have learnt and been able to grow from all of these people whom we regard as part of our family. None have quite captured and guided our minds to the extent that Tom Lubbe from Matassa has. Tom is a true gentleman with an incredible view of the world. His kind sensibility and nurturing personality has not only helped guide us but has had an incredible impact on winemakers across the globe.`,\n    STORY_2: `Tom Lubbe is a New Zealander who grew up in South Africa. In the late 90’s, Tom was working at the only estate in South Africa using indigenous yeasts and lower yields. He helped innovate and shape the wine scene in South Africa and forged the space for winemakers like Craig Hawkins (Testalonga) whom spent several vintages working with Tom to flourish. Interested in working with Mediterranean varietals, Tom managed to score a 3-month internship at the legendary Domaine Gauby in the village of Calce. Gérard Gauby quickly befriended Tom and asked him to come back for three consecutive vintages as cellar helper. During that time, Tom met his wife Nathalie, who just so happens to be Gérard’s sister. The birth of their first child halted Tom’s plan of returning to South Africa, opting instead to stay in Calce and start his own estate.`,\n    STORY_3: `In total, Domaine Matassa consists of 15 hectares, 13ha of which surround the village of Calce and 2ha in the high Fenouillèdes. The soils around Calce are predominantly schist and marl and the co-planted vineyards consist of Local varietals; Grenache Gris, Macabeu, Muscat d’Alexandrie, Muscat Petit-Grain, Grenache Noir, Lladonner Pelut, Carignan and Mourvedre. The wind battered vineyards in Fenouillèdes are old vine Carignan and Lladonner Pelut at 500-600m altitude on granitic soils. The vineyards are un-irrigated, bush-vines pruned to the “gobelet” technique.The vineyards are worked naturally without any chemical aids. Tom is certified organic by Ecocert and uses biodynamic techniques such as Preparation 500 and various plant fermentations to activate and nourish his soils. Tom is passionate about continuing to diversify his agriculture away from simple monoculture. He has recently planted seven different varieties of old, local olives which have been deliberately mixed up like the old vineyards, which are never one variety. Tom also sows up to 15 different plants in between his vineyard rows, which contribute to a greater diversity of soil microbiology.\n      Tom’s logic and ideas in the vineyard translate to the cellar where he aims to have a wine full of mineral energy. These days most of Toms wines are bottled with less than 10mg/l of total sulphur reflecting transformation in the health and vitality of his vineyards over the last decade. His whites often see maceration on skins and Tom’s approaches to reds see whole-bunch ferments. All wines are fermented on natural yeasts and are finished unfiltered and unfined. Tom’s vines are incredibly low yielding, giving the wines gorgeous concentration and minerality. These are true wines of terroir that could not be reproduced anywhere else.\n      Tom’s wines have seen a huge evolution as the heath of his Old Vine vineyards and his understanding of how to work with them has developed. His cuvees have captured the hearts and minds of sommeliers and wine drinkers worldwide.`,\n    LIST: [{\n      ID: 0,\n      WINE: \"Coume de L'Olla Blanc\",\n      PRODUCER: \"Matassa\",\n      COUNTRY: \"France\",\n      REGION: \"Roussillon\",\n      VARIETY: \"Muscat petit grain/Maccabeu\",\n      STYLE: \"White\",\n      ABOUT: `50% Muscat Petit Grain, 50% Macabeu.

After obtaining a BTS viticulture-oenology diploma in Beaune in 2015, she trained in different domains across France (Domaine Thibault Liger Belair at Nuits Saint-Georges, Domaine de la Grange Tiphaine in Amboise, Vincent Pinard at Sancerre, Clos du Rouge Gorge in Latour-de-France).`,\n    STORY_2: `In 2018, she returned to her native land in Puisaye-Forterre, on the borders of Burgundy and halfway between Sancerre and Chablis.

Thorsten Melsheimer took over the 200 year old family estate in 1994 and immediately began cultivating his vineyards organically. Since 2009 all the vineyard work has been done according to biodynamic principles, receiving its Demeter certification in 2013. The estate consists of 11 hectares, 8 of which grow on the steep hill of the Mullay-Hofberg in Reil, a renowned winemaking village in the Mosel. The weathered slate and quartzite soils of the Mullay-Hofberg hillside have been home to vines since the 12th century. This undulating vineyard sits below a forest and plateau - helping the plants retain water and preventing excessive vine stress even in the hottest vintages.`,\n    STORY_2: `The Mosel is known for its many steep slopes. Among them, only 5% are categorised as very steep slopes and thus particularly valuable cultural assets. What helps to make Melsheimer so special is that almost half of Thorsten’s vines are in these 5% and grow in some of the least accessible and most vertiginous parcels of the Mullay-Hofberg. The family also has vines growing in the Goldlay vineyard, situated just opposite the village of Reil, as well as some parcels in the Pündericher Marienburg, Burger Hahenschrittchen, Thomasberg and Reiler Falklay. The microclimate and terroir around Reil guarantee a long ripening period, creating the perfect conditions for Riesling. Despite the challenges of working on these steep slopes, Thorsten tirelessly rebuilds old terraces and nurse’s old vines back to life. He is passionate about building biodiversity in his vines and has seen dramatic changes to the ecosystem since taking over the estate just over 20 years ago. The family recently introduced goats to the vineyards to help maintain the ever encroaching forest and to provide manure for the vines.`,\n    STORY_3: `In the cellar Thorsten prefers to take a more hands off approach. He makes no additions or manipulations to the wines preferring to express what nature has given him in each vintage.

He is forever experimenting using techniques such as skin contact to try and add a different element to his wines.

Below is a little about the story of Colombaia and what makes this tiny farm so special.`,\n    STORY_2: `The Colombaia farm in Colle Val d‘Elsa in the hamlet of Mensanello, has been in Dante Lomazzi’s family for several generations. The vineyard was planted in 1970 and after a promising career outside of winemaking Dante decided to return to his family farm with his wife Helena in 1999. They immediately got stuck into converting the farm to organic viticulture and from there certified in biodynamics in 2003. The idea was to treat this very special 4ha plot like a big garden, with fruit trees, vegetable gardens and flowers surrounding the vines. The now 45+ year old vineyards are planted to Tuscany’s native grapes of Sangiovese, Colorino, Malvasia Nera and Canaiolo. They also planted a small additional hectare to denser plantings of Sangiovese 10 years ago, which is maturing into a beautiful site in which they make their Neuva cuvee.`,\n    STORY_3: `They have a simple cellar, set up to use the flow of gravity and to not need mechanical pumps. Grapes are hand picked and only have to travel about 50 metres to the cellar. Fermentation takes place predominantly in concrete and undergoes the traditional “a capello sommerso” (submerged cap) for fermentation. Wines are aged in Slavonian oak for extended periods of time and many cuvees have several bottling dates. The idea behind this to show how the wines age during different vintage conditions. Sulphur is only used in warmer vintages and very sparingly if at all.\n      The wines from Colombaia reflect the very special farm they are from. They age beautifully and are an absolute joy to drink from the electric Ancestral through to the almost 10 year old cuvees of sangiovese.

The influence of harvests with Jean Foillard and La Coste where they learned respect for soils, grapes and nature deeply shows both through their wines and overall philosophy. And so, without any degrees or diplomas they started to attack the vineyard work and fermentation in a very experimental spirit, but with the same desire to work with respect and without heavy-handed intervention. Despite both still working full time with other jobs they have managed to dedicate every spare minute to Lammidia, and the results continue to blossom.`,\n    STORY_3: `They have around 5 hectares of vines 700 metre above sea level in the hills above Pescara in the small village of Villa Celiera.

The majority of their vines are planted to Montepulciano and Trebbiano d’Abruzzo but they also have a little Pinot Noir, Barbera, Pecorino and Moscato. They do not move the earth in the vineyards at all but cut surrounding plant life and leave it as mulch on the soil to keep in moisture and to protect the surface. In the cellar they work predominantly with cement tanks but also use mediums such as Anfora and Fibreglass for some cuvees.\n      There is a great diversity throughout their range of wines as they work with different methods, such as white with skin maceration, Carbonique and whole bunch.

The country seems primed on paper for winemaking full of promise; great terroir, cold and diverse micro-climates and a general level of sensibility to the people that should by all means yield boundless excitement. Enter Tincan, the brain child of Laura Tinnelly (TIN) and Nick Candy (CAN). After many years spent working in New Zealand, Australia and travelling around the world growing and making wine they decided to settle in Nelson and start a brand. Nick is the winemaker and viticulturist, while Laura manages the marketing and back of house side of the winery as well as traveling between New Zealand and the USA for work.`,\n    STORY_2: `Nick has spent the last 18 years slowly crafting his own philosophy about wine and vines. His winemaking journey began with a degree at Lincoln University, before he went on to work at Felton Road and Peregrine in Central Otago, Riversun nursery in Marlborough, Mcwilliams in Australia and Domaine Stephane Montez in the Rhone Valley. The call to return home to be with family became too strong and Nick decided to settle in Nelson. The 2016 Vintage was somewhat of a collaboration with good friend and likeminded winemaker Alex Craighead of Kindeli. After a successful first vintage in 2016 Nick decided to lease a small 6 ha vineyard in Nelson. Nick is a Viticulturist first and foremost and a winemaker second. He is passionate about getting the vineyards to his exacting standards through hard work and dedication. He is firmly committed to minimal intervention organic farming and his 6 ha of vineyards will be certified by the 2019 vintage. He makes minimal passes through the vines with tractor preferring to do all of his vineyard work by hand to avoid soil compaction where possible.`,\n    STORY_3: `In the cellar he carries this same minimal intervention organic principle. He makes his wines with absolutely no additions including no sulphur and all wines are fermented from wild yeasts in the vines and cellar.

They wanted to grip the earth with their toes and use their knowledge of organic farming and permaculture to create their very own wine label. Creating a sense of community was a deep part of this plan, a place to call home and where they could raise their daughter Frankie around home grown food, great music and with a love and appreciation for the land.`,\n        STORY_2: `They lease three vineyards and are planning the planting of two more on their farm, which is located on the outskirts of Mt Gambier, SA. The property and all of the leased vineyards are located on the south side of one of Australia’s youngest volcanoes. Erupting less than 6000 years ago it is filled with water that changes colour with the seasons. Arising from an ancient inland sea made into limestone and now receiving water from underground caves added with our generous rainfall all contributes to the abundance of water stored in underground limestone caves with pockets of flint rock spread below the nearby soils. The limestone filters the water naturally and the result is a pure water thriving with minerality. All this helps make for incredible soil complexity and their cool climate makes for perfect growing conditions and in turn beautiful, elegant and totally unique wines like no other.`,\n        STORY_3: `They make wines that reflect the eccentricities of their own personalities as well as deeply reflecting place and terroir with a minimalistic approach. They use old world wine methods; preferring the challenges of hand picking fruit, open fermenting with indigenous yeast and only adding sulphur when required by the wine. They do not filter or fine wines and they are all bottled on site in their small winery.\n      Mount Gambier is a truly unique wine growing region and one that over the next few years is due likely to grow in understanding and popularity. Over the last few years these wines have gone from strength to strength as cuvees have tightened and become more precise.

Despite only meeting his great grandfather as a two year old Dan feels an incredible connection to him and his nordic heritage. His middle name is Sigurd and despite copping a small amount of grief through high school he proudly uses it his brand name.`,\n        STORY_2: `His grandfather travelled from Norway to find work in Australia back in the early days (he was 19, so around 1914) and found the quickest way to become a citizen was to join the army, so he was sent over to Europe fight for Australia. A larrikin at heart he was caught AWOL after being shot early into his service and then sent back to the front lines in France as punishment, where he was shot again…. This time in the elbow which made him useless at holding a gun, luckily this time he was sent back to Australia. His stories amongst the family were legendary and his constant smile and mischievous behaviour was always something Daniel related to. For any of you who have met Dan you will of course know this to be true.`,\n        STORY_3: `Daniel grew up in central western New South Wales and from a young age was immersed in grape growing and winemaking. During school holidays he would pick up work with large wineries picking fruit or pruning vines. This led him to Charles Sturt University where he completed his double Wine/Viticulture degree at Wagga Wagga. His desire to understand different regions led him to vintages in New Zealand (Central Otago), Canada (Okanagan Valley), Portugal (Alentejo), France (Hermitage) and Italy (Barolo). After spending some time back in Australia working for Jacobs Creek his desire to start a small label focusing on organically grown grapes stated to burgeon. He knew that the mechanical, conventional way of doing things wasn’t for him and so in 2012 Sigurd was born. He moved to a smaller winery RedHeads studio wines, which he was given the task of re-invigorating. This also allowed Dan to explore his own label on the side. The first wine under Sigurd was a quirky single hogshead of Riesling fermented with Gewürztraminer skins just labeled as the white. From here a red GSM (now GSMN), Rose, Chenin, Syrah and now Carignan have joined the range with fleeting appearances of Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.\n      Every vintage of Sigurd is subtly different, be it a change in the blend or style to best show off that years conditions. For the most part Dan’s grapes are sourced or grown under organic principles, something he is working hard to have across the board. Once in the cellar his wines are as hands off as possible with only indigenous yeasts used, no adjustments of acid or tannin and minimal sulphur added at bottling (max 30ppm). He is proud of the Barossa Valley and his reds in particular speak of the richness of the terroir while still harbouring an immense freshness and drinkability, not always an easy task in one of Australia’s warmest regions. Dan is one of the most exciting winemakers coming out of the Barossa and we are so thrilled with his evolution over the last few years.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Sigurd Riesling\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Sigurd\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Australia\",\n            REGION: \"Eden Valley, Barossa Valley\",\n            VARIETY: \"Riesling\",\n            STYLE: \"White\",\n            ABOUT: `A mixture of 90% high Eden Valley fruit from the white blend vineyard and 10% Clare Valley fruit from the Chenin Blanc vineyard, this Riesling was fermented in a separate 1600L Foudre and Barrique, pressed as whole bunches straight to oak, left for around 7 months and then racked off solids and in to tank where a small amount of sulphur was added before bottling.

After moving to Melbourne in 2010 to pursue a physiotherapy degree and chase his dream of playing representative cricket he got a job working at his local Dan Murphy’s. Bit by bit over his two years at Dan’s he began to feel more intrigued and comfortable around wine and so after finishing his degree he decided to enrol back into university but this time at Charles Sturt for Viticulture and Winemaking. Whist studying he returned to Tasmania and spent a season pruning in the vines at Stefano Lubaina and a year working the wine bar and cellar door at Moorilla.\n      It was by chance at one of the first editions of Bottletops that he met Pat Underwood from Little Reddie and was struck by the world of minimal intervention wine. In late 2016 following this meeting he moved up to Victoria and completed his first vintage at the Boomtown Cooperative winery followed by a full season working at both Oakridge and then Mac Forbes where he spent most of his time helping to manage the vineyards. Post the 2019 harvest with Mac he jetted over to his father’s homeland of Germany to complete vintage with fellow Lo-Fi winery Melshimer. Here he pursued his love of Riesling and worked closely with Thorsten in both the vines and cellar.`,\n        STORY_3: `It was however, the time with Mac that really made him fall in love with the viticultural side of things and what led him back to Tasmania in late 2019 to head up the vineyard and cellar at the very ambitious Mewstone Wines. Here Luke manages almost 6 hectares under vine with the vineyard recently becoming certified organic and he helps make both the Mewstone and Hughes & Hughes wines in their new cellar at the home vineyard in Flowerpot. This is where he makes his Sonnen Wines.\n      Sonnen for Luke is the exploration of all he has learnt across his short journey in wine. He wants the wines to speak deeply of Tasmania and the vineyards they are sourced from but have an experimental edge when it comes to winemaking. His release from 2021 wowed us, with his Jannis Riesling a particular highlight, almost reminiscent of the orange wines of Melsheimer. Luke is helping to forge a new path of minimal intervention wines in Tasmania and we cant wait to see Sonnen shine in the years to come.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Blume\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Sonnen\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Australia\",\n            REGION: \"Tasmania\",\n            VARIETY: \"Riesling Blend\",\n            STYLE: \"White\",\n            ABOUT: `kanamaluka / Tamar River & Coal Valley A pseudo-Alsatian style blend of 75% Riesling from the Coal and 25% Gewurztraminer from the Upper Tamar.

When Michael finished agricultural school in 2002 it was clear that he wanted to run the farm that his family had owned since 1807. This farm has always practiced mixed agriculture with crops, livestock, forestry and wine. Michael was fascinated with fermentation and took over the responsibility for vinification during his school years. He followed the common doctrine but was never happy with his early wines. It was only through stepping back and looking at the wines of his grandfather, a man who worked much more simply, with nearly no manipulation or intervention that Michael found his style and mantra. In 2012 Inspired by this he converted his winery and vineyards to Demeter bio-dynamics and began experimenting. Now Michael takes holistic farming to new heights with what he calls ‘close-circuit bio-dynamics’ - nothing comes into the winery, nothing comes out. This includes his barrels, which he makes himself from Acacia wood from the nearby forest.`,\n        STORY_2: `His 10 hectares of vines are planted extremely densely, with 7,000-10,000 vines per hectare growing on loam and loess soil. This forces the vines to behave highly competitively, resulting in low yields of highly concentrated fruit. He uses cover crops to keep down weeds and pest control is handled by the buzzards (Buteos) that roam the vineyards. He tucks his shoots instead of cutting them off at the top so that the energy of the plant goes to the fruit, rather than the stress of making new shoots at the cut end. A plethora of animals also inhabit the Gindl farm. Highland cattle have been bred since 2012, his 3 horses manage all of the work in the vineyards and a flock of goats and Breton dwarf sheep help to manage the weeds and increase fertility.`,\n        STORY_3: `In 2012 along with his certification Michael decided to rename and brand his property. He landed on MG vom Sol. Sol is the oldest vineyard ever documented in his hometown of Hohenruppersdorf, with plantings dating back to the 14th century. His grandfather revitalised this site, replanting to Gruner Veltliner and Weissburgunder 45 years ago. This remains the only Single Vineyard wine he makes preferring to harvest his 10 hectares by hand in three passes, picking on flavour and ripeness to create his special blends. To preserve the individuality and genuineness obtained in the vineyards, Michael try’s to do as little as possible in the cellar. The grapes are pressed very gently, rarely racked and fermented spontaneously without any use of selected yeast or temperature control. The wines remain on the lees for a very long time and selected cuvees get a small dose of sulphur dioxide before bottling.\n      Michaels is above all a farmer and a very talented one at that. His love for his vines, animals and their interaction makes his one of the most inspiring people we have come across. His wines are pure, unique, and energetic speaking deeply from the land on which they are grown.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Farm White\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Michael Gindl\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Austria\",\n            REGION: \"Weinviertel\",\n            VARIETY: \"Gruner Veltliner Blend\",\n            STYLE: \"White\",\n            ABOUT: `A white blend made from direct pressed Gruner Veltliner, Gelber Muskateller and Riesling.

Some will know the Beaufort name here in Australia and after making the wines of his family estate for many years he recently broke away from the family business to focus on his own Champagne project. In late 2021 Amaury Beaufort released his first champagne under his own name, from a 0.88ha champagne parcel called Le Jardinot in Polisy and we are delighted to have just received a small top up of stock just in time for Christmas.`,\n        STORY_2: `After completing viticultural studies in Beaune in 2005, he worked many years for his family estate, Champagne André Beaufort, helping ensure the succession to his own generation. In parallel with the projects of his family, he planted 5ha near Tonnère, and produced still wine from 2007 until 2017 as Les Larmes de Divona. By 2018, Amaury sought a clean break. He split off from his work with the family, and began farming his own 0.88ha parcel in Polisy the way he liked. A gentle, mostly east-facing slope of pinot noir on kimmeridgian clay-limestone, capped with a section of chardonnay on portlandian clay limestone, Le Jardinot (as the parcel and the resultant champagne are called) is bordered on two sides by woodland. Planted in 1972, right after Amaury’s father Jacques Beaufort’s conversion to organics, the parcel has never seen synthetic treatments. It comprised part of Champagne André Beaufort until 2018, when Amaury broke off from the family enterprise to pursue his own champagne production.`,\n        STORY_3: `Beaufort takes care to understate the differences that led him to break from the family estate and his négociant work with his brothers. But it doesn’t take much reading between the lines to see where Amaury’s priorities lie in viticulture. “For me the system is there always needs to be life in the soil,” he says. “Practically all the vignerons who work organically, they farm the vines, but they don’t farm the soil. They plow, they remove all the grass. Then it’s all naked. But there are a lot of microorganisms that need grass cover. I want my soil to play the role of a sponge. So when it rains, it absorbs it, and when it’s dry, only the surface dries out.” Here the under-emphasized issue is that maintaining grass cover entails a drop in yields, and the financial loss is all the more significant in regions where land is astronomically expensive. Beaufort also prefers to avoid vine trimming, finding it encourages root expansion and a greater resistance to pests and problems. Beaufort also credits late, careful pruning, in successive stages, with allowing him to avoid 2021’s catastrophic frosts.\n      In the cellar Beaufort ages his vin clairs for up to 21 months, this is extraordinarily long for Champagne vignerons working at his scale. With his close proximity to Burgundy, Amaury’s vinification techniques are more similar to Burgundy than classic Champagne. Fermentation begins in large 15hl oval casks. He doesn’t do battonage by hand, the shape of his casks allows for natural battonage. The wines are then transferred to Demi-muids for settling and further ageing. Wines are full natural fermentation with secondary fermentation from a selection natural yeast cultures the family have been using for over 20 years. No sulphur is added through the process and all wines remain unfiltered and unfined.\n      For us this is the most striking Champagne we have come across. It has a remarkable purity and linearity, something commonly seen in the past still wines he has produced. We are immensely proud to be brining these to Australia in extremely small amounts and look forward to expanding his range with a Rose and Coteaux Champenoise in the coming months.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Jardinot\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Amaury Beaufort\",\n            COUNTRY: \"France\",\n            REGION: \"Champagne\",\n            VARIETY: \"Pinot Noir Blend\",\n            STYLE: \"Sparkling\",\n            ABOUT: `The first iteration of Jaridnot, spontaneous fermentation in barrels with no added sulphites, Aged for 17 months in barrels and thick-stave casks, bottled with harvest yeasts, disgorged without dosage 10/14/21.

She is deeply committed to organic farming and biodynamic practices are an obvious way to express the full identity of these great soils. In addition to this she hand sows cover crops in-between her rows to continue the addition of diversity in her vineyards.`,\n        STORY_3: `From the outset, in order to better understand the intrinsic identity of each of its 8 plots, she made the choice to separate the grapes in small vats. Élodie has decided to vinify the wine as naturally as possible. After the first harvest she decided to cut out sulphur completely and the wines are made now with zero additions whatsoever. Maturing in concrete vats has also become important for her, giving the wines a fine tannic structure, delicacy and freshness.\n      The first release in Australia is her Cote du Rhone Blend and in the coming years we look forward to welcoming her very first classified Châteauneuf-du-Pape wines.

Before settling in Bugey he worked with the likes of Domaine de la Soufrandière (Bret Brothers), Philippe Jambon in Beaujolais as well as in Canada. In his spare time he also works for the Association des Producteurs Bio du Rhône et de la Loire whose aim is to help winegrowers to convert to organic farming and viticulture, a goal he is deeply passionate about.\n      The estate of Grangeons de l’Albarine consists of nearly 2.5 ha of vineyards spread over several sites. 1.2 ha are worked on the incredibly steep slope of Argis (pictured above) and divided into two parcels, the Chateau, and Paradis. These vines are nearly 50 years old on a limestone base and planted to Chardonnay, Rousette and Monduse. In addition, a 0.5 ha 50 year old plot called Combernand, “La Cluse des Peintres” was taken over in 2014 in nearby Rossillon, with three grape varieties: Gamay, Chardonnay and Aligoté. This site has a gentler east-facing slope and is planted to pebbly soils. In 2015 Luc added what he now regards as his most prized site 0.4 ha of vines in St Sorlin en Bugey. The site named “Clos de Beauregard” sits on a hillside overlooking the Rhone, with 60-year-old vines of Gamay and Altesse planted over rocky shards of limestone. Finally a small plot of Mondeuse and Chasselas was also taken again in 2015, with 0.5 ha of 20-year-old vines that have a denser limestone over clay soils.`,\n        STORY_3: `The array of vineyards that Luc has assembled is all worked by hand. They are very tough sites and we were in awe of how hard he works and how challenging the site must be to manage. All of these sites have been converted to organic farming and are certified. Luc employs biodynamic principles to his vineyards and hopes to certify over the next few seasons. In the cellar Luc’s desire is to produce wines that speak of the terroir of Bugey. As such his winemaking style is very neutral. He direct presses his whites to old wooden vessels, his reds he keeps on skin in stainless tanks for a short time before pressing to the same old wooden barrels. All wines are wild fermented and remain unfiltered and unfined, instead being racked a few times before bottling for purity and clarity. He adds small amounts of sulphur for each cuvee where he sees a need for it.\n      The wines of Les Grangeons de l’Albarine are as wholesome as they come. They speak deeply of the forgotten region of Bugey and show absolute purity through each cuvee. We have not been as excited about a new producer for a while.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Le Grangeon Mano\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Les Grangeons de l’Albarine\",\n            COUNTRY: \"France\",\n            REGION: \"Bugey\",\n            VARIETY: \"Chardonnay\",\n            STYLE: \"White\",\n            ABOUT: `15 year old Chardonnay vines grown at 320m in elevation on an extremely steep south facing slope on exposed limestone and grey marl.

Despite the grapes low reputation Dominique has been planting the on serious terroirs overlooking Lac Leman (Lake Geneva) and farming them biodynamically since day one. Lucas is a 5th generation winemaker who migrated from his native Burgundy, frustrated with the region’s reliance on chemicals. He landed at a small local winery at Ballaison, on the shore of Lake Geneva. Here, he founded Les Vignes de Paradis, where he trains vines in a chaotic, unpruned method reminiscent of Burgundy’s Lalou Bize-Leroy.`,\n        STORY_2: `His vines are separated into 27 parcels of different soil composition (rich yellow marl and granite soils with a limestone base, and some silex stones), each of which is harvested by hand (he says it takes 2.5 months to harvest here as Chasselas takes so long to ripen), and vinified separately. He is deeply committed to Chasselas, and has also added tiny parcels of Savagnin, Pinot Gris, Gamay, and Chardonnay. These are not old vines, but in the hands of this careful winemaker they are capable of producing wines of depth and complexity.`,\n        STORY_3: `Though his family’s history is steeped in Burgundian ways, you won’t find much of this influence in his cellar. Dominique vinifies his grapes in an array of different amphorae, barrels, and concrete eggs – no doubt a hint at his close friendship with Dominique Belluard who lives about an hour away in Ayse. Fermentations occur naturally and the only addition to the wines is a small amount of sulphur at bottling. His commitment to experimentation is key, such as his recent project of building concrete pyramids out of sand, rocks and water all found on his small property for future fermentations.\n      Lucas’ wines are full of tension and intrigue.

Neither of them had any experience or formal education as winemakers prior to opening their own winery, nor did they come from vigneron families. Ludwig studied viticulture remotely while working as an architect in Paris, and ultimately decided to leave to pursue his passion for viticulture and wine production. Ludwig had fallen in love with Burgundy, and completed time working with a good friend in Saint Aubin. He had initially hoped to purchase land there, however due to financial constraints, the family found that the Jura proved significantly better suited for them. This led to the purchase of Les Chais du Vieux Bourg (now Lulu Vigneron) in 2000. Their first vintage came shortly after in 2002.`,\n        STORY_3: `The original vineyard is about 2.5 hectares in Arlay, in the centre of the Jura, and Ludwig has since expanded the estate to include vineyards in Poligny, l’Etoile and the legendary Château-Chalon. Their vineyards are all organic and they do not use any insecticides, chemical fertilizers or machinery. They are currently going through biodynamic conversion for all vineyards and hope to achieve certification by the 2019 vintage. The soil is very unique, with two marly layers and a calcareous stratus, which is rich in fossilized oysters. Vine age varies from new vines of Trousseau that replaced his previous holdings of Pinot Noir to 55-year-old vines of Savignan.\n      Ludwig’s motto “the wine is made in the vineyard” is exemplified by the fact Ludwig works with the vines every day. He has a completely natural approach to wine making with a dedication to a non-interventionism and an affinity for making wine in a traditional style. He only takes the best clusters during selections, and uses almost mad pruning techniques to keep yields as low as possible. Ludwig’s fermentations are done at very low temperatures, lengthening the process for up to two years. This helps create very complex wines with depth and layers.\n      These have always been some of our favourite wines.

We have learnt and been able to grow from all of these people whom we regard as part of our family. None have quite captured and guided our minds to the extent that Tom Lubbe from Matassa has. Tom is a true gentleman with an incredible view of the world. His kind sensibility and nurturing personality has not only helped guide us but has had an incredible impact on winemakers across the globe.`,\n        STORY_2: `Tom Lubbe is a New Zealander who grew up in South Africa. In the late 90’s, Tom was working at the only estate in South Africa using indigenous yeasts and lower yields. He helped innovate and shape the wine scene in South Africa and forged the space for winemakers like Craig Hawkins (Testalonga) whom spent several vintages working with Tom to flourish. Interested in working with Mediterranean varietals, Tom managed to score a 3-month internship at the legendary Domaine Gauby in the village of Calce. Gérard Gauby quickly befriended Tom and asked him to come back for three consecutive vintages as cellar helper. During that time, Tom met his wife Nathalie, who just so happens to be Gérard’s sister. The birth of their first child halted Tom’s plan of returning to South Africa, opting instead to stay in Calce and start his own estate.`,\n        STORY_3: `In total, Domaine Matassa consists of 15 hectares, 13ha of which surround the village of Calce and 2ha in the high Fenouillèdes. The soils around Calce are predominantly schist and marl and the co-planted vineyards consist of Local varietals; Grenache Gris, Macabeu, Muscat d’Alexandrie, Muscat Petit-Grain, Grenache Noir, Lladonner Pelut, Carignan and Mourvedre. The wind battered vineyards in Fenouillèdes are old vine Carignan and Lladonner Pelut at 500-600m altitude on granitic soils. The vineyards are un-irrigated, bush-vines pruned to the “gobelet” technique.The vineyards are worked naturally without any chemical aids. Tom is certified organic by Ecocert and uses biodynamic techniques such as Preparation 500 and various plant fermentations to activate and nourish his soils. Tom is passionate about continuing to diversify his agriculture away from simple monoculture. He has recently planted seven different varieties of old, local olives which have been deliberately mixed up like the old vineyards, which are never one variety. Tom also sows up to 15 different plants in between his vineyard rows, which contribute to a greater diversity of soil microbiology.\n      Tom’s logic and ideas in the vineyard translate to the cellar where he aims to have a wine full of mineral energy. These days most of Toms wines are bottled with less than 10mg/l of total sulphur reflecting transformation in the health and vitality of his vineyards over the last decade. His whites often see maceration on skins and Tom’s approaches to reds see whole-bunch ferments. All wines are fermented on natural yeasts and are finished unfiltered and unfined. Tom’s vines are incredibly low yielding, giving the wines gorgeous concentration and minerality. These are true wines of terroir that could not be reproduced anywhere else.\n      Tom’s wines have seen a huge evolution as the heath of his Old Vine vineyards and his understanding of how to work with them has developed. His cuvees have captured the hearts and minds of sommeliers and wine drinkers worldwide.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Coume de L'Olla Blanc\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Matassa\",\n            COUNTRY: \"France\",\n            REGION: \"Roussillon\",\n            VARIETY: \"Muscat petit grain/Maccabeu\",\n            STYLE: \"White\",\n            ABOUT: `50% Muscat Petit Grain, 50% Macabeu.

The winery sits on the periphery of what is still considered Burgundy, being geographically almost closer to the Loire than it is to the heart of Burgundian production. After obtaining a BTS viticulture-oenology diploma in Beaune in 2015, she trained in different domains across France (Domaine Thibault Liger Belair at Nuits Saint-Georges, Domaine de la Grange Tiphaine in Amboise, Vincent Pinard at Sancerre, Clos du Rouge Gorge in Latour-de-France).`,\n        STORY_2: `In 2018, she returned to her native land in Puisaye-Forterre, on the borders of Burgundy and halfway between Sancerre and Chablis. Raphaëlle is intrepid in her viticulture endeavours, seeing potential in the 0.5ha Les Hates parcel that was completely overgrown by wild vegetation and fruit trees, and painstakingly working it back to life to producing outstanding Pinot Noir. The vines she works with are always densely planted, and she believes that working the soils hard and regularly at the start, couple with biodynamic farming, is the key to producing exceptional quality fruit in the future. She began her Domaine with only 1.5ha under vine, and has replanted another 3ha with 6 more to come from a plot of land she has converted to mixed biodynamic farming. Raphaëlle has dreams to increase this to an impressive 15ha, and encourage diversity in the crops on the farm, including oat, wheats and lentils. She is actively integrating cattle and livestock into her vineyards and farms.`,\n        STORY_3: `All of her wines display a distinct freshness and the deft touch of a mature winemaker who is committed to working in a low intervention manner, but who will intervene where necessary.

He prefers to ferment in concrete to keep purity and age all of his wines in old French oak. His wines are bright, clean and joyful.

Thorsten Melsheimer took over the 200 year old family estate in 1994 and immediately began cultivating his vineyards organically. Since 2009 all the vineyard work has been done according to biodynamic principles, receiving its Demeter certification in 2013. The estate consists of 11 hectares, 8 of which grow on the steep hill of the Mullay-Hofberg in Reil, a renowned winemaking village in the Mosel. The weathered slate and quartzite soils of the Mullay-Hofberg hillside have been home to vines since the 12th century. This undulating vineyard sits below a forest and plateau - helping the plants retain water and preventing excessive vine stress even in the hottest vintages.`,\n        STORY_2: `The Mosel is known for its many steep slopes. Among them, only 5% are categorised as very steep slopes and thus particularly valuable cultural assets. What helps to make Melsheimer so special is that almost half of Thorsten’s vines are in these 5% and grow in some of the least accessible and most vertiginous parcels of the Mullay-Hofberg. The family also has vines growing in the Goldlay vineyard, situated just opposite the village of Reil, as well as some parcels in the Pündericher Marienburg, Burger Hahenschrittchen, Thomasberg and Reiler Falklay. The microclimate and terroir around Reil guarantee a long ripening period, creating the perfect conditions for Riesling. Despite the challenges of working on these steep slopes, Thorsten tirelessly rebuilds old terraces and nurse’s old vines back to life. He is passionate about building biodiversity in his vines and has seen dramatic changes to the ecosystem since taking over the estate just over 20 years ago. The family recently introduced goats to the vineyards to help maintain the ever encroaching forest and to provide manure for the vines.`,\n        STORY_3: `In the cellar Thorsten prefers to take a more hands off approach. He makes no additions or manipulations to the wines preferring to express what nature has given him in each vintage. All village wines undergo a long fermentation in old oak barrels - the dry Rieslings can take up to 18 months to complete fermentation. He is forever experimenting using techniques such as skin contact to try and add a different element to his wines. His sulphur regime is also very low adding less than 30 parts through all of his wines with his top wine Vade Retro remaining unsulphured.\n      Thorsten remains one of the most hands-on and experimental winemakers in the area and receiving his wines are always a rare treat for us.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Trocken\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Melsheimer\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Germany\",\n            REGION: \"Mosel\",\n            VARIETY: \"Riesling\",\n            STYLE: \"White\",\n            ABOUT: `This dry Riesling comes from the weathered slate soils near the village of Reil including the renowned plots of Reiler Goldlay, Pündericher Marienburg, Burger Hahnenschrittchen and Reiler Falklay.

He found sites that were alive with flora and fauna, healthy cover crops and with exposures that only require 1-2 sprays of sulphur per season. Everything is done by hand in the vineyard, while all sites are picked and fermented separately. The 120+ year old cellar is ripe with of native microbiological flora and the grapes arrive with extremely healthy yeast populations, allowing for fermentation to take place with only native yeasts and no additives.

None were more impressive than the afternoon we spent at Colombaia. Away from the populous subregions Tuscany is know for, this little farm operates in a truly humble and understated way. We were taken a back by the immense quality of the wines Dante and Helena have produced as well as their welcoming nature. Below is a little about the story of Colombaia and what makes this tiny farm so special.`,\n        STORY_2: `The Colombaia farm in Colle Val d‘Elsa in the hamlet of Mensanello, has been in Dante Lomazzi’s family for several generations. The vineyard was planted in 1970 and after a promising career outside of winemaking Dante decided to return to his family farm with his wife Helena in 1999. They immediately got stuck into converting the farm to organic viticulture and from there certified in biodynamics in 2003. The idea was to treat this very special 4ha plot like a big garden, with fruit trees, vegetable gardens and flowers surrounding the vines. The now 45+ year old vineyards are planted to Tuscany’s native grapes of Sangiovese, Colorino, Malvasia Nera and Canaiolo. They also planted a small additional hectare to denser plantings of Sangiovese 10 years ago, which is maturing into a beautiful site in which they make their Neuva cuvee.`,\n        STORY_3: `They have a simple cellar, set up to use the flow of gravity and to not need mechanical pumps. Grapes are hand picked and only have to travel about 50 metres to the cellar. Fermentation takes place predominantly in concrete and undergoes the traditional “a capello sommerso” (submerged cap) for fermentation. Wines are aged in Slavonian oak for extended periods of time and many cuvees have several bottling dates. The idea behind this to show how the wines age during different vintage conditions. Sulphur is only used in warmer vintages and very sparingly if at all.\n      The wines from Colombaia reflect the very special farm they are from. They age beautifully and are an absolute joy to drink from the electric Ancestral through to the almost 10 year old cuvees of sangiovese. We are delighted to share these rare and special wines with you and show off the amazing work of this dedicated couple.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Ancestral Rose\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Colombaia\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Italy\",\n            REGION: \"Tuscany\",\n            VARIETY: \"Sangiovese Blend\",\n            STYLE: \"Pet Nat\",\n            ABOUT: `Soil : Rich clay in fossil shells Grapes : Sangiovese, Colorino, Malvasia Nera and Canaiolo Age of Vines: 40 years`,\n            IMG: \"./images/Colombaia/Ancestral-Rose.jpg\",\n          },\n          {\n            ID: 1,\n            WINE: \"Bianco\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Colombaia\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Italy\",\n            REGION: \"Tuscany\",\n            VARIETY: \"Trebbiano/Malvasia\",\n            STYLE: \"Skin Contact\",\n            ABOUT: `Soil : Rich clay in fossil shells Grapes : Trebbiano 70%, Malvasia 30% Age of vines: 45 years Vinification: 4 month long skin maceration`,\n            IMG: \"./images/Colombaia/Bianco.jpg\",\n          },\n          {\n            ID: 2,\n            WINE: \"Vigna Nuova\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Colombaia\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Italy\",\n            REGION: \"Tuscany\",\n            VARIETY: \"Sangiovese\",\n            STYLE: \"Red\",\n            ABOUT: `Soil: clay rich in fossil shells, Grapes: Sangiovese 97% , Colorino 3% Vine Age: 9 years Vinification: Natural fermentation on skins for 2 months in tank and aged in tank for 15 months.`,\n            IMG: \"./images/Colombaia/Vigna-Nuova.jpg\",\n          },\n          {\n            ID: 3,\n            WINE: \"Rosso Toscana\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Colombaia\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Italy\",\n            REGION: \"Tuscany\",\n            VARIETY: \"Sangiovese\",\n            STYLE: \"Red\",\n            ABOUT: `With the great practice of multiple bottling's off the one vintage our access to back vintages constantly revolve and change.

The influence of harvests with Jean Foillard and La Coste where they learned respect for soils, grapes and nature deeply shows both through their wines and overall philosophy. And so, without any degrees or diplomas they started to attack the vineyard work and fermentation in a very experimental spirit, but with the same desire to work with respect and without heavy-handed intervention. Despite both still working full time with other jobs they have managed to dedicate every spare minute to Lammidia, and the results continue to blossom.`,\n        STORY_3: `They have around 5 hectares of vines 700 metre above sea level in the hills above Pescara in the small village of Villa Celiera.

The majority of their vines are planted to Montepulciano and Trebbiano d’Abruzzo but they also have a little Pinot Noir, Barbera, Pecorino and Moscato. They do not move the earth in the vineyards at all but cut surrounding plant life and leave it as mulch on the soil to keep in moisture and to protect the surface. In the cellar they work predominantly with cement tanks but also use mediums such as Anfora and Fibreglass for some cuvees.\n      There is a great diversity throughout their range of wines as they work with different methods, such as white with skin maceration, Carbonique and whole bunch. It’s just a part of their philosophy and mission, constantly testing new ways in cultivation, fermentation and storage. All wines are made with zero additions or manipulation including no sulphur additions at bottling. Their wines are constantly evolving and their slogan Uva e Basta (100% grape) reigns true with every vintage and micro cuvee.`,\n        LIST: [\n          {\n            ID: 0,\n            WINE: \"Sciambagn Pet Nat\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Lammidia\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Italy\",\n            REGION: \"Abruzzo\",\n            VARIETY: \"Trebbiano\",\n            STYLE: \"Pet Nat\",\n            ABOUT: `A pet nat given by the fruit from their Bianchetto cuvee, refermented in bottle thanks to the addition of fresh must from Bianco Anfora.`,\n            IMG: \"./images/Lammidia/Sciambagn-Pet-Nat.jpg\",\n          },\n          {\n            ID: 1,\n            WINE: \"Bianchetto\",\n            PRODUCER: \"Lammidia\",\n            COUNTRY: \"Italy\",\n            REGION: \"Abruzzo\",\n            VARIETY: \"Trebbiano\",\n            STYLE: \"White\",\n            ABOUT: `Crushed and destemmed, one night skin contact and aged in fiberglass and steel. 9.5% alc.

After many years spent working in New Zealand, Australia and travelling around the world growing and making wine they decided to settle in Nelson and start a brand.

The call to return home to be with family became too strong and Nick decided to settle in Nelson. The 2016 Vintage was somewhat of a collaboration with good friend and likeminded winemaker Alex Craighead of Kindeli.

He is passionate about getting the vineyards to his exacting standards through hard work and dedication.
